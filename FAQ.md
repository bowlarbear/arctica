Why does my hardware wallet not automatically boot into ubuntu?

There could be a few reasons this is happening. Some computers have a BIOS that always defaults the boot order to one of the internal drives...in which case you will always be required to boot into the BIOS (usually by quickly pressing F1, F2, & F3 after hitting the power button.) and manually set the device first in the boot priority menu.

If you still cannot boot it's possible that you are using SD cards in a native SD card slot, this might a PCI slot rather than a USB slot (for example, thinkpad T490/T490s). Try using usb sticks or a usb stick SD card reader dongle. 

Why does X/Y/Z feature just not work?
I have found that with extensive testing, flash memory sticks will start to fail (repeated use and reimaging). Sometimes unexplained errors occur and drives need to be replaced. Plenty of the cheap generic usb sticks you can get on amazon on just complete garbage and do not perform well as bootable hardware wallets. Personally I have found great success in purchasing Kingston USB 3.2 Data Traveler Exodia 32Gb sticks. These brands are more expensive and likely overkill but they perform well and are quite reliable.
